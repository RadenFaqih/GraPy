POSSIBLE NEW FEATURES

	*add functionality for adding nodes, and automatically finding the best place in the graph to place them

	*attempt to hide concurrency from users
	*attempt to hide the internal data structures from users

CURRENT TODO'S

	*go through the entire code, and make sure it abides by python conventions
