GraPy (A simple force directed graph library for Python).
====================


GraPy is a simple library that makes it easy for users to create interactive force directed graphs. It utilises PyGame to allow for custom draw functions for nodes, relationships, foreground and background of the graph. The visualisation comes with default dragging functionality for nodes, however, users can poll for mouse events in order to create their own custom behaviours. Since the visualisation runs in a separate thread, the user can add, delete and edit nodes and relationships and have their changes appear in realtime in the visualisation.
